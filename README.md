Implementing applications build on algorithms on hardware using digital electronics logic and designs

Code for CHAIN REACTION IS WRITTEN FOR ARDUINO IDE, SO GIVING CODE IN .txt format
file name: finalcode.txt

Project CHAIN REACTION requires DFS algorithms and some implementation to tackle hardware problems.
Also registers ICs Data sheet to know about ICs pins, so that coding implementation becomes easy.
Multicolor RGB leds are used and SISO register to transfer data for LEDS on board.

For reference download game from google play store and play :).
