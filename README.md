Implementing applications build on algorithms on hardware using digital electronics logic and designs

Project CHAIN REACTION requires DFS algorithms and some implementation to tackle hardware problems.
Also registers ICs Data sheet to know about ICs pins, so that coding implementation becomes easy.

For reference download game from google play store and play :).
